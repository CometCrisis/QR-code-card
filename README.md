## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- I learned the importance of having a good understanding of HTML and CSS. Despite going through bootcamp programs and coding along with each video I found it difficult when left to start a project from scratch.
- I learned that reducing the size of the image-qr-code was a possibility. Beforehand I was working with the image in its native size which caused a lot of issues. I learned the code below with the help of google.

```html
<img src="images/image-qr-code.png" width="300" height="300" alt="qr code" />
```

- in the next project I want to look into measurements like font size, div size, and image size because for the most part I was just eye-balling the size. However, I am thankful that the sytle guide was provided.
- google was a major asset for this project but I feel like I had to google how to do this project every step of the way. But It was a good learning lesson.

### Continued development

- I'm still very new when it comes to web development so I want to focus a lot on polishing my css skills. This project has shown me the importance on how to center divs, round out divs, and adding colors.

### Useful resources

- [frontendresource.com](https://frontendresource.com/css-cards/) - This helped me get an understing of how my html and css should be structured. A lot of the projects were too advanced for me to understand but gave me an idea on how to tackle this project.
- [getcssscan.com](https://getcssscan.com/css-box-shadow-examples) - This website helped me add a boxshadow to the qr card because I didn't know how to make one close enough to the desktop design. I would recommend it to others because it gives an example of how the box shadow will look like.
